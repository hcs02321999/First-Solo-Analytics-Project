#Life Expectancy and GDP Portfolio Project
Hello, this project is apart of my codecademy class progress.
In this project there are 6 nations defined over 15 years, spanning from 2000-2015. The countries that are in this datset are USA, Zimbabwe, Chile, China, Germany and Mexico.
Through the use of the pythons libraries I was able to get a better understanding if a countries GDP has a correlation with their respective life expectancy at birth.
